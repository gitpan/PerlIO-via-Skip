PerlIO-via-Skip version 0.01
============================

This module implements a PerlIO layer that discards lines from IO
streams. By default, all lines are accepted and passed-through as if no
filters are present.  Input filters discard input lines, and output
filters discard output lines; therefore, input lines (that meet user's
criteria) are excluded from input, and in a similar manner 
when specified, output lines are omitted from output.

The code is re-entrant. Multiple filters can be
stacked together without interfering with one another.
These filters were designed for read, write, and append handles
( 'r', 'w', 'a'), but will refuse installation
for read-write mode.
